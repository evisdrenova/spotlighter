# Spotlighter

**Spotlighter** is a Visual Studio Code extension that dims everything outside of the current Rust function you’re editing. It helps you focus on the specific function or method under your cursor by lowering the opacity of all other code in the file.

## How It Works

- When your cursor is inside a function, Spotlighter uses symbols to determine that function’s boundaries.
- It applies a “dim” decoration to everything else, so the function you’re working on stays fully visible.
